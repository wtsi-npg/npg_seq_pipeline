script_must_be_unique_runner

=head1 SYNOPSIS

npg_pipeline_script_must_be_unique_runner -job_name=<part of job name which determines the script that is running>  -own_job_name=<unique job name identifying this job>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If the script on the farm cannot run at the same time as another script of the same name, then this can be used as
a pre_exec_command with the option of the part of the job name which describes the script running.

i.e.

  bsub -J 'a_script_that_i_like_to_run_20090924-145409' -E 'npg_pipeline_script_must_be_unique_runner -job_name=a_script_that_i_like_to_run -own_job_name=a_script_that_i_like_to_run_20090924-145409' 'a_script_that_i_like_to_run -id_run=1234'
  bsub -J 'a_script_that_i_like_to_run_20090924-145410' -E 'npg_pipeline_script_must_be_unique_runner=a_script_that_i_like_to_run -own_job_name=a_script_that_i_like_to_run_20090924-145410' 'a_script_that_i_like_to_run -id_run=2345'

Once one of these has started to run, the other won't until it has finished. This can only work as long as part of
the job name whenever these are launched are the same, but unique enough only to launching this script
(e.g. The scriptname itself ought to be good)

=head1 USAGE

See DESCRIPTION

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

job_name
own_job_name

=head1 OPTIONS

No additional optional arguments

=head1 EXIT STATUS

1 if another copy is running, 0 if not.
This satisfies the way that LSF determines if it is OK to proceed with the job in hand, or needs to put it back to pending
