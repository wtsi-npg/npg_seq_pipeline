Notes for t/data/novaseqx_47539 directory

A set of files that is sufficient to mock a NovaSeqX run folder
for a real run 47539. Some lanes of this run have multiple
samples with different references. The number of samples in
each lane was reduced to simplify mocking the runfolder and
the reference repository.
