  abstract: 'Given the central importance of Africa to studies of human origins, genetic diversity and disease susceptibility, large-scale and representative characterisation of genetic diversity in Africa is needed. One of the biggest challenges in reconstructing genomes from short read data is the limited phasing information. The use of DNA libraries containing long range linkage information could present a significant advantage. These high coverage data for 1 Baganda (Uganda) trio with extensive pedigree data and already sequenced relatives and 1 Baganda child, whose parents have been already sequenced at high depth, have been generated from GemCode (10x Genomics) DNA libraries containing long range linkage information.'
