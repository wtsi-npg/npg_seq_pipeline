=head1 NAME

npg_pipeline::daemon::archival

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $runner = npg_pipeline::daemon::archival->new();
  $runner->loop();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A daemon for invoking the archival pipeline.
Inherits most of functionality, including the loop() method,
from the npg_pipeline::daemon class.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 run

Invokes the archival pipeline for runs with the current status of
'archival pending'. Returns after successfully invoking the archival
pipeline for one run regardless of whether there are other runs that
could have been considered for archival.

The number of runs that can be archived concurrently is throttled, no
more that five runs can be moved to archival in an hour between all
archival daemons.
