npg_pipeline::roles::business::flag_options

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyPackage;
  use Moose;
  ...
  with qw{npg_pipeline::roles::business::flag_options};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role gives some boolean flag options which can be set
on construction (or via the command line if using MooseX::Getopt)
so that you can turn off global features/functions.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 verbose

Boolean option to switch on verbose mode

=cut

has q{verbose} => (
  isa           => q{Bool},
  is            => q{ro},
  documentation => q{Boolean decision to switch on verbose mode},
);

=head2 no_summary_link

Do not create a summary link

=cut

has q{no_summary_link} => (
  isa           => q{Bool},
  is            => q{ro},
  lazy          => 1,
  builder       => '_default_to_local',
  documentation => q{Turn off creating a Latest_Summary link},
);

=head2 no_array_cpu_limit

flag option to allow job arrays to flood, if able, the farm

=cut

has q{no_array_cpu_limit} => (
  isa           => q{Bool},
  is            => q{ro},
  documentation => q{Allow job arrays to keep launching if cpus available},
);

=head2 array_cpu_limit

set the most number of cpus which each job array can use at a time, applied only if no_array_cpu_limit not set

=cut

has q{array_cpu_limit} => (
  isa           => q{Int},
  is            => q{ro},
  lazy_build    => 1,
  documentation => q{Set the most number of CPUs that a Job array can use at a time},
);
sub _build_array_cpu_limit {
  my ( $self ) = @_;
  return $self->general_values_conf()->{array_cpu_limit};
}

=head2 no_irods_archival

Switches off archival to iRODS repository.

=cut

has q{no_irods_archival} => (
  isa           => q{Bool},
  is            => q{ro},
  lazy          => 1,
  builder       => '_default_to_local',
  documentation => q{Switches off archival to iRODS repository.},

## no critic (ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines)
sub _default_to_local {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->local;
}
## use critic

=head2 no_warehouse_update

Switches off updating the NPG warehouse.

=cut

has q{no_warehouse_update} => (

  lazy          => 1,
  builder       => '_default_to_local',
  documentation => q{Switches off updating the NPG warehouse.},
);

=head2 no_sf_resource

do not use sf resource tokens; set if working outside the npg sequencing farm

=cut

has q{no_sf_resource} => (
  isa           => q{Bool},
  is            => q{ro},
  documentation =>
  q{Do not use sf resource tokens; set if working outside the npg sequencing farm},
);

=head2 no_bsub

disable submitting any jobs to bsub, so the pipeline can be run, and all cmds logged

=cut

has q{no_bsub} => (
  isa           => q{Bool},
  is            => q{ro},
  documentation =>
  q{Turn off submitting any jobs to lsf, just logging them instead},
);

=head2 local

sets the default for no_irods_archival, no_warehouse_update and no_summary_link to true;
defaults to the value of no_bsub flag

=cut

has q{local} => (
  isa           => q{Bool},
  is            => q{ro},
  lazy_build    => 1,
  documentation => q{Turn off lots of archiving and updating flags},
);
