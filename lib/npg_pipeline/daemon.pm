=head1 NAME

npg_pipeline::daemon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package npg_pipeline::daemons::my_pipeline;
  use Moose;
  extends 'npg_pipeline::daemon';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Moose parent class for npg_pipeline daemons.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 dry_run

Dry run mode flag, false by default.

=head2 pipeline_script_name

An attribute

=head2 build_pipeline_script_name

Builder method for the pipeline_script_name attribute, should be
implemented by children.

=head2 seen

=head2 npg_tracking_schema

=head2 run_command

Runs the pipeline script. Returns 1 if successful, 0 in
case of error.

=head2 runs_with_status

With one argument, which should be a valid run status description,
returns a list of DBIx::Class::Row objects from the Run result set,
which correspond to runs with the current status descriptiongiven
by the argument.
  
  # find runs with current status 'archival pending'
  my @rows = $obj->runs_with_status('archival pending');

With two arguments, the first one a valid run status description,
the second one a DateTime object, returns a subset of the list
that is returned by this method with one argument. The additional
selection condition is that the time of timestamp of the run status
should be after the time given by the second argument.

  # find runs which have current status 'archival in progress' and
  # have reached this status within the last two hours
  my $date = DateTime-now()->subtract(hours => 2);
  my @rows = $obj->runs_with_status('archival in progress', $date);

In both cases a list of returned objects is sorted in the assending
run status timestamp order.

If no run satisfies the conditions given by the argument(s), an
empty list is returned.

=head2 local_path

Returns a list with paths to bin the code is running from
and perl executable the code is running under

=head2 runfolder_path4run

Returns runfolder path for given id_run

=head2 run

Single pass through the eligible runs. An empty implementation in
this class. Should be implemented by children.

=head2 loop

An indefinite loop of calling run() method with 15 mins pauses
between the repetitions. Any errors in the run() method are
captured and printed to the log.
