=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Moose role providing utility methods for iRODS context.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 irods_root_collection_ns

Configurable iRODS root collection path for NovaSeq data.
Defaults to C<illumina/runs> .

=cut

has 'irods_root_collection_ns' => (
  isa           => 'Str',
  is            => 'ro',
  required      => 0,
  default       => $IRODS_REL_ROOT_NOVASEQ_RUNS,
);

=head2 irods_pp_root_collection

Returns the relative iRODS root collection path for the output of portable
pipelines, C<illumina/pp/runs>. Can be used both as an instance method
and a class (package) level method.

=cut

sub irods_pp_root_collection {
  return $IRODS_REL_PP_ROOT;
}

=head2 irods_destination_collection

Returns iRODS destination collection for the run.
This attribute will be built if not supplied by the caller.
C</seq> is used as the root of all collections.

Examples of return values: C</seq/425>, C</seq/illumina/runs/34/34567>.

=cut

has 'irods_destination_collection' => (
  isa           => 'Str',
  is            => 'ro',
  required      => 0,
  lazy_build    => 1,
);
sub _build_irods_destination_collection {
  my $self = shift;
  my $c;
  try {
    $c = $self->irods_collection4run_rel(
      $self->id_run, $self->per_product_archive());
  } catch {
    $self->logcroak($_);
  };
  return join q[/], $PRODUCTION_IRODS_ROOT, $c;
}

=head2 per_product_archive

A boolean flag indicating whether products are archived to individual
collections or all data are on the top level of the same collection.

Is set to true for NovaSeq runs, false otherwise.

=cut

has 'per_product_archive' => (
  isa           => 'Bool',
  is            => 'ro',
  required      => 0,
  lazy_build    => 1,
);
sub _build_per_product_archive {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->platform_NovaSeq() || $self->platform_NovaSeqX();
}

=head2 irods_collection4run_rel

Returns a relative path the run's destination collection. For the production
iRODS this path does not have the root C</seq> component. This method can
be used as an instance method and a class (package) level method. If used
as a class (package) level method, a hardcoded common iRODS path
C<illumina/runs> is used for NovaSeq (or newer) platform runs. In the
instance method this path can be customised by setting the
C<irods_root_collection_ns> attribute of the object. For objects it might be
more convenient to use the C<irods_destination_collection> attribute.

If the second argument is not present, a flat run-level archive is assumed.

  my $rc = $obj->irods_collection4run_rel($id_run);
  my $per_product_archive = 1;
  $rc = $obj->$obj->irods_collection4run_rel($id_run, $per_product_archive);
  
  $rc = npg_pipeline::product::release::irods->
    irods_collection4run_rel(45666, 0);
  print $rc; # prints 45666

  $rc = npg_pipeline::product::release::irods->
    irods_collection4run_rel(45666, 1);
  print $rc; # prints illumina/runs/45/45666

=cut

sub irods_collection4run_rel {
  my ($self, $id_run, $per_product_archive) = @_;

  $id_run or croak 'Run id should be given.';
  my @path = ($id_run);
  if ($per_product_archive) {
    unshift @path, int $id_run/$THOUSAND;
    # Is this method called as a class/package method or an instance method?
    # For an instance method we need to retain the ability to configure
    # the relative path for NovaSeq runs. 
    unshift @path, ref $self
                   ? $self->irods_root_collection_ns
                   : $IRODS_REL_ROOT_NOVASEQ_RUNS;
  }

  return join q[/], @path;
}

=head2 irods_product_destination_collection

Returns iRODS destination collection for the argument product.

  my $pc = $obj->irods_product_destination_collection(
                 $run_collection, $product_obj);

=cut

sub irods_product_destination_collection {
  my ($self, $run_collection, $product) = @_;
  my $dc;
  try {
    $dc = $self->irods_product_destination_collection_norf(
          $run_collection, $product, $self->per_product_archive());
  } catch {
    $self->logcroak($_);
  };
  return $dc;
}

=head2 irods_product_destination_collection_norf

Returns iRODS destination collection for the argument product.
Can be use as a package-level or class method since all its inputs are
given as arguments. If the third argument is not present, the platform
is not considered as NovaSeq or newer (producing a flat hierarchy).

  my $product = npg_pipeline::product(rpt_list => '34567:2:1');
  my $pc = $obj->irods_product_destination_collection_norf(
                 $run_collection, $product);
  my $per_product_archive = 0;
  $pc = $obj->irods_product_destination_collection_norf(
    'some/irods/path/34/34567', $product, $per_product_archive);
  print $pc; # prints some/irods/path/34/34567 
 
  $per_product_archive = 1;
  my $product = npg_pipeline::product(rpt_list => '34567:2:1');
  $pc = npg_pipeline::product::release::irods->
    irods_product_destination_collection_norf(
    'some/irods/path/34/34567', $product, $per_product_archive);
  print $pc; # prints some/irods/path/34/34567/lane2/plex1
  
=cut

sub irods_product_destination_collection_norf {
  my ($self, $run_collection, $product, $per_product_archive) = @_;

  $run_collection or croak('Run collection iRODS path is required');
  $product or croak('Product object is required');
  return $per_product_archive
    ? join q[/], $run_collection, $product->dir_path($product->selected_lanes)
    : $run_collection;
}

=head2 is_for_irods_release

Return true if the product is to be released via iRODS, false otherwise.

  $obj->is_for_irods_release($product)

=cut

sub is_for_irods_release {
  my ($self, $product) = @_;

  my $enable = !$self->is_release_data($product)
                ? $self->_siblings_are_for_irods_release($product)
                : $self->_is_for_release($product, 'irods');

  $self->info(sprintf 'Product %s, %s is %sfor iRODS release',
                      $product->file_name_root(),
                      $product->composition->freeze(),
                      $enable ? q[] : q[NOT ]);

  return $enable;
}

=head2 is_for_pp_irods_release

Return true if the portable pipeline product is to be released via iRODS,
false otherwise.

  $obj->is_for_pp_irods_release($product)

=cut

sub is_for_pp_irods_release {
  my ($self, $product) = @_;
  return $self->_is_for_release($product, $IRODS_PP_CONF_KEY);
}

=head2 glob_filters4publisher

Returns a hash with glob filters for
L<iRODS Tree Publisher|https://github.com/wtsi-npg/npg_irods/blob/master/bin/npg_publish_tree.pl>,
which might be specified in the study configuration in the 'pp_irods' section.
If the 'filters' key is present, the 'include' filter should be present. The
'exclude' filter is optional.

The format for both filters is validated. It is expected that an array of
filter expressions is present.

  my $filters = $self->glob_filters4publisher($product)

=cut

  my ($self, $product) = @_;

    for my $filter_type (qw/include exclude/) {
      if (defined $gfilters->{$filter_type}) {
        my $filters = $gfilters->{$filter_type};
        (ref $filters eq 'ARRAY') or
          croak qq(Malformed configuration for filter '${filter_type}'; ) .
            q(expected a list, but found: ) . pp($filters);
      } else {
        if ($filter_type eq 'include') {
          croak q(No 'include' filter);
        }
      }
    }
