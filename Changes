LIST OF CHANGES
---------------

 - purge carriage returns (as well line feeds) from study descriptions for RG header
   records (xml lims driver has previously done this as part of XML parsing)
 - require minimum version 5.10 for perl
 - add study analysis configuration accessor
 - simpler name for the archival daemon module
 - parent class for pipeline daemons
 - dry_run option for daemons
 - consistent behaviour of the archival and analysis daemons
   when LIMs data are not available in the ml warehouse and
   the run is not a QC run, the run is skipped
 - the pipeline daemons define the type of the pipeline to run
   (default, gclp, qc) and set appropriate backward-compatible
   options for the pipeline script
 - Log::Log4perl logger is used in pipeline daemons
 - cached samplesheet generation - use ml warehouse for all
   runs except QC runs, for which the old warehouse is still used
 - add npg_pipeline_job_env_to_threads script (to avoid excessive repeated perl one-
   liners in command arguments).
 - archival of logs should run after an asynchronous move to outgoing (peformed by the
   staging daemon) - paths adjusted and job preexec checking for the existence of the
   runfolder in outgoing is added

release 49.8
 - seq-alignment now uses bwa_aln_se for single read runs
 - disable log archival pending enhancements

release 49.7
 - seq-alignment - P4 and new bwa for older chemistries & forcing mem for alt references
 - bug fix after passing RG paramater to illumina2bam: change SplitBamByReadGroup options:
     do not set OUTPUT_COMMON_RG_HEAD_TO_TRIM, strip last component (runid_lane) from
     OUTPUT_PREFIX
 - use threading for bam and cram creation in seq_alignment
   references and GCLP
 - add attribute "gclp" common to analysis and archival scripts
 - function list config files always contain pipeline module name e.g. central

release 49.6

 - call new bam_flagstats execute method instead of invoking individual parsers explicitly -
   forward compatibility
 - npg_pipeline::cache - reuse_cache_only option added RT#486264
 - check for an inline index when calculating index_length

release 49.4
 - LSF job creation for autoqc checks - use qc check objects directly when

release 49.3
 - error if padding for spiked Phix index sequence is not long enough
 - kill unwanted jobs efficiently (one command for all ids and -b option)
 - call warehouse loaders with verbose option
 - call ml warehouse loader at the end of the analysis pipeline so that the product
   table is loaded by the time the run goes into QC thus allowing to query this
   warehouse using run id
 - simplified name generation for fastq files
 - use 'subset' option of the bam_flagstast autoqc result instead
   of the 'human_split' option
 - allow p4 to be used where no alignment is specified for target but human
     split (contains_nonconsented_human) is
 - new tests for various p4 analysis options in seq_alignment
     (20-archive_file_generation-seq_alignment.t)

release 48.8

release 48.4
 - Make group to change analysis directories to optional
 - use LSB_BIND_CPU_LIST over LSB_MCPU_HOSTS to determine number of threads to use
   within a job (cope with hyperthreading where LSF gives one slot to what is presented

 - make number of slots used by seq_alignment configurable
 - allow running on file server by
   + use npg_tracking::util::abs_path to patch absolute paths

     that is currently needed in SeqQC
 - gclp-specific function list for archival

release 48.2

     both analysis and archival daemon to pass runfolder path to the
     pipeline script;
     if batch_id is available, pass it to the analysis pipeline script    
 - use appropriate driver for samplesheet generation (xml, warehouse, ml_warehouse)
 - GCLP compliance-related pipeline changes:
     get the flowcell barcode needed for
     accessing LIMs information from runfolder path/content;
     use batch id if provided by the caller;
     derive the run id from runfolder path/content
 - check for RTA run tag is dropped in the analysis daemon - all current runs are RTA
 - use alt_process flag when archiving qc runs

release 47.7

   sapiens reference, use of nonconsented human split only with non Homo sapiens reference.
